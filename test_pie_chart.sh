echo "🎯 Test Scenarios:"
echo "   1. REGULAR USER: Select user cleaners → observe progress → see pie chart"
echo "   2. SYSTEM ADMIN: Run 'sudo cleansys' → select system cleaners → real cleaning"
echo "   3. CHART TOGGLE: Press 'c' to cycle between chart types"
echo "   4. COMPLETION: Watch timer stop and status change to FINISHED"
echo ""
echo "🔧 What to expect:"
echo "   • Status starts as 'READY', changes to 'CLEANING', ends as 'FINISHED'"
echo "   • Timer counts up during operations, stops at completion"
echo "   • Total freed bytes accumulates (not 0)"
echo "   • Pie chart visible in 'Items Distribution (Count)' section"
echo "   • No layout overlaps on any terminal size"
echo "   • System operations show (sudo) indicators"

echo "💡 Testing Tips:"
echo "   • Try both with and without sudo to see the difference"
echo "   • Resize terminal to test responsive layout"
