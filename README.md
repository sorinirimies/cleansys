cleansys menu

# Run user-level cleaners with confirmation
cleansys user

# Run user-level cleaners without prompts
cleansys user --yes

# Run system-level cleaners (requires root)

- `PgUp/PgDn`: Scroll operation log
- `Home/End`: Jump to first/last item

### Actions
- `Space`: Toggle selection

## üì± Responsive Design

CleanSys features a fully responsive terminal interface with multiple breakpoints:

| Terminal Width | Layout Features |
|---------------|----------------|
| < 60 columns | Minimal UI, chart hidden, essential information only |
| 60-79 columns | Compact layout with reduced chart |
| 80-119 columns | Balanced layout with full chart |
| 120+ columns | Spacious layout with maximum information density |

## üéØ View Modes

- **Standard Mode**: Balanced layout with full feature visibility (default)
- **Compact Mode**: Condensed layout for smaller terminals (<25 rows)
- **Detailed Mode**: Maximum information density with extended statistics
- **Performance Mode**: Focus on operation metrics and real-time monitoring

## üìä Chart Visualization

Press `c` to cycle through different chart types:

1. **Bar Chart**: Traditional vertical bar chart showing cleaned items
2. **Pie Chart (Count)**: Distribution by number of items cleaned
3. **Pie Chart (Size)**: Distribution by bytes cleaned

All charts automatically adapt to terminal size and include:
- Percentages
- Legends
- Color coding
- Smart label positioning

## üîç Detailed View

After cleaning operations, view comprehensive details:
- Complete list of cleaned files and directories
- Full file paths
- Individual file sizes
- Timestamps
- Scrollable with `j/k` or `PgUp/PgDn`
- Search functionality with `/`

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility functions (permissions, formatting)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.rs             # Application state and logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events.rs          # Event handling (keyboard, resize)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ render.rs          # UI rendering logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pie_chart.rs       # Chart visualization component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ menu.rs            # Text-based interactive menu
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs            # Entry point and TUI setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs             # Public API and documentation
